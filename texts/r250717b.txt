Thank you for t he opportunity to speak to you today.1  I am here to discuss o ne of 
the most important resources that policymakers have: the lessons of  history.  In 
discharging my responsibilities at the Federal Reserve, I have been thinking a lot  about 
history .  Its study  provides the opportunity to step out of the particular circumstances of 
today to inform our unde rstanding of the core issues at the heart of financial regulation .  
While we must be attentive to new and even un precedented  challenges, experience shows 
that understanding the lessons of history gives  policymakers a great advantage.   Many of 
the decisions we face today  have, in some form, been confronted by previous generations 
of policymakers.  
In these remarks, I want to discuss  a particular pattern  in the history of the 
financial system, which is the relationship between  regulatory weakening  and the 
economic and financial cycle of booms and busts .  My intent is not to re -hash well -
examined facts or to go over past historical episodes chapter and verse.  R ather, I  aim to 
offer a perspective on this historical throughline  that focuses on the regulatory cycle . 
It’s widely accepted  that the economy and financial system experience cyclical 
booms and busts.  B ooms have historically been characterized by a multitude  of good 
things .  These can include fast economic growth, workers who had been sidelined 
enter ing the workforce and improv ing their lives, and financial innovations  that often 
make credit or investments more readily available .  At the same time, some of the 
characteristics of a boom economy , such as rapid increases in credit and in financial 
market activity , as well as greater risk -taking and leverage,  can sow the seeds of busts .  In 
busts , economic activity and lending contract  and asset prices decline.  This  can lead to

rapid deleveraging and dislocation throughout the financial system, which worsen the 
downturn, causing job losses  and business closures, homes lost and lives upended. 
There are usually multiple  causes that drive booms and make busts  so terrible , 
some unique to each individual  episode.  But one factor that is  common to many past 
cycles of boom and bust is weakening financial regulation.  Weakening regulation often 
drive s risk-taking and increases bank fragility during the boom, making  the ensuing bust  
more painful.   Indeed, economic research suggests that weaker regulation leads to more 
bank failures, setting the stage for worse recessions.2  Moreover, because the financial 
system evolves so rapidly , regulation must also continuously adjust.  Much regulatory 
weakening occurs simply when  regulators fail to keep pace, while at other times , there is 
a deliberate action  to lower regulatory burden that ends up miscalculating the risk 
involved.  Let me be clear here that , when I refer to regulatory weakening, I mean not 
only direct deregulatory actions by regulators  or legislators , but also failure  of the 
regulatory framework  to keep up with changing circumstances .   
In principle , financial regulation should incentivize banks to engage in 
responsible risk -taking and build up resources in good times , so that  they can deal with 
times of financial stress  and continue their vital role in the economy  in bad times .  The 
prosperity that accompanies a healthy economy should allow  banks to invest in improved 
risk management and strong financial resources.  However, a healthy economy can also 
reduce the effectiveness of regulatory constraints  on bank risk -taking .  This can occur  for 
a host of reasons, includ ing behavioral biases , political pressure , market dynamics, and

Risk:  Evidence from 1900 to 1930,” Journal of Financial Intermediation , vol. 22 (3), pp. 285 –307; and

the tendency for innovation to move more quickly tha n regulators .  These dynami cs can  
result in regulatory weakening during boom time s.  When actively pursued, t his 
weakening often appears justified at  the time  and may be  implemented by well -meaning 
policymakers who simply miscalculate the long- run effects  of their actions.   
My purpose in these remarks is to recount several boom -and-bust episodes in 
American history and identify  some lessons that can guide policymakers entrusted with 
the responsibility of promoting a strong and stable banking system.  T his history 
demonstrates the connection between regulatory weakening and cycles of bo om and bust.  
I don’t mean to suggest that more regulation is always better or that repealing and 
reforming  regulations isn’t sometimes appropriate  to remove obsolete r ules and relieve  
unnecessary burden.  But , if we can at least agree that regulation should seek  to limit 
devastating financial crises, then the history  that I will describe today offer s some lessons 
for anyone thinking about regulatory policy.   
There are, of course , lots of examples to choose from, both in the United States 
and abroad, but I’ll focus on the Great Depression, the  Savings and L oan ( S&L)  crisis, 
and the Global Financial Crisis.  I will then discuss some possible reasons that similar  
episodes could re cur and conclude with some thoughts on the lessons we can learn . 
The Great Depression  
Let’s start with the biggest and most widely studied bust in U.S. history, the Great 
Depression.  S cholars continue to debate its  causes, which were multiple and complex.  
One compelling argument  focuses on the failure of regulation to keep pace with the 
innovations of the Roaring Twenties.  As I said, I view such regulatory stagnation as a 
form of weakening.  This  weakened regulatory envir onment  played a role in setting the  - 4 - 
stage for and then exacerbating the bust.  Weak ened  regulation that had failed to keep up 
with the times left banks unable to weather shocks to the economy.  T he banking sector’s  
collapse was a significant factor in making the Great Depression the most severe 
economic crisis that this country has ever experienced.3   
The Roaring Twenties expansion was powered  by the post -war recovery and 
technological advances in transportation, manufacturing, and communication s.  Stock 
markets grew quickly to help finance this innovation, while  residential and commercial 
real estate investment surged  and swelling  demand for consumer durables led  in turn to 
increased demand for financ ing.4  As credit needs escalated, there was intensifying 
competition among banks ; savings and loan institutions  (S&Ls) ; and rapidly growing 
nonbank finance companies , trust companies, and other financial  vehicles .  
The 1920s were also characterized by high levels of financial speculation, both 
inside and outside the banking sector.  Banks engaged in speculation through nonbank 
affiliates and supported speculation by l ending.  At the same time, many banks were 
relatively thinly capitalized  and overly concentrated, especially given the lack of federal 
deposit insurance  at the time .  In addition, many states had prohibitions on branching that 
prevented banks from diversifying their portfolios and inhibited local competition,

Depression,” American Economic Review , vol. 73 (3), pp. 257– 76.

keeping many struggling banks alive.5  The stock market  boomed, margin lending grew 
dramatically, a nd insider trading and market manipulation were rampant . 
As the financialization of the economy increased, the regulatory framework failed 
to keep up.  Outdated branching restrictions remained, failing to reflect the size and 
dynamism of  the modern economy.  Banks gained permission to engage in new activities , 
such as real estate lending  and certain activities in the securities markets ; however , 
capital requirements and other rules  were not adjusted to reflect potential increased risks 
from these new activities .6  The cumulative effect of these events was a significantly 
weakened regulatory environment  and a substantial buildup in risk, without a 
commensurate inc rease in resources to allow the sector to withstand the risks posed.   
Looking back, we know that , when the economic shock hit,  the banking system 
magnified that shock.  The boom of the Roaring Twenties started to go bust in 1929, 
when the fast growth of the past decade turned to contraction, followed  by a series of 
financial and banking crises .  In all, approximately 9,000 of the nation’s 23,000 banks 
failed, resulting in major losses to depositors, given the lack of federal  deposit insurance , 
and a significant contraction in credit that deepened and lengthened the e conomic 
 
5 National banks received authorization to engage in branching, subject to state law , in 1927 but interstate 
branching remained prohibited.   
6 Before  1900, national banks were prohibited from underwriting, dealing, or investing in securities.  
However, federal authorities loosened these restrictions by allowing national banks to establish bond 
departments that could underwrite, sell, and invest in debt  securities.  Although restrictions on dealing in 
stock remained, national banks were able to circumvent these restrictions by organizing affiliates that 
engaged in the full range of activities with regard to both stocks and bonds.  Federal regulatory auth orities 
did not interfere with these affiliate activities.  Scholars continue to debate the extent to which this 
underwriting activity was risky for the banks.  See Wilmarth  Jr., “Does Financial Liberalization Increase 
the Likelihood of a Systemic Banking Crisis? ” (see note 4); and Eugene Nelson White (1986), “Before the 
Glass -Steagall Act:   An Analysis of the Investment Banking Activities of National Banks,” Explorations in 
Economic History , vol. 23 (1), pp. 33– 55.    - 6 - 
downturn.7  Notably, banks in states that  had more robust regulatory frameworks —for 
example , those that applied higher capital requirements —had lower rates of failure .8   
In response to the financial collapse in  the Great Depression, Congress adopted 
reforms aim ed at  addressing  risks that had dr iven those panics.  Among these steps, 
Congress established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and federal deposit 
insurance to reduce the risk of bank runs and protect retail depositors.  Congress  
increased regulatory oversight  of banks  and separated commercial and investment 
banking.  Congress also  enacted strong securities laws and created the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) .  Overall, these steps helped  stabili ze the financial sector  
and ushered in a long period of quiescence in banking.  
The Savings &  Loan Crisis  
My second example today is the S&L c risis of the 1980s and early 1990s, which 
did substantial harm  to millions of Americans  and the financial system  and was 
extremely expensive  to resolve .  In this episode , in contrast to the Great Depression, 
affirmative  deregulation  led to excessive risk -taking by S&Ls , as well as banks,  during a 
boom period .  As circumstances soured, revealing weaknesses, Congress attempted  to 
bolster the  S&L sector  by looseni ng the regulat ory framework  further.  This failed to 
resolve the underlying stress and instead  further fueled  the buildup in risk -taking, 
worsening the losses  in the subsequent bust .

Let me first set the stage .  The years leading up to the S&L c risis were 
characterized by dramatic growth in business  credit , in the course of the economic 
expansion that began in 1982.  At the beginning of this period, the S&L sector  primarily 
served the residential real estate market  because of  restrictions on S&L activities.  T hese 
restrictions  eased over the 1980s , allowing S&Ls to ge t significantly larger and engage in 
new kinds of lending; h owever , these changes were not accompanied  by sufficient 
regulatory  enhancements to account for increased risk s.  This expansion in S&L activity 
also presented new competition with commercial banks, which had themselves built up 
significant risks as they expanded into new activities .9 
At the same time, both S&Ls  and banks  were increasingly under pressure due to 
both high inflation and high interest rates, which disrupted their funding model s.10  
Competition for customer funds increased dramatically, especially because of  the rise of 
money market mutual funds, which had grown rapidly.  When  Congress remove d 
outdated deposit rate  caps to  allow banks and S&Ls to more effectively compete for 
funds , it did so without implementing  adequate safeguards  against these institutions 
taking on excessive risk .  This led many S&Ls to engage in increasingly risky projects to 
compensate for escalating funding costs .  Banks  also increased their deposit rates and 
took on more  risk. 
As vulnerabilities  at S&Ls became evident, Congress, federal regulators, and the 
states attempted to bolster both sectors with the hope of allowing them to outgrow those 
 
9 Federal regulators, as well as many state legislatures and state banking authorities,  expanded the scope of 
permissible activities for banks during this period.   
10 For example, S&Ls  made  long- term, fixed rate residential mortgage loans, funded with short- term retail 
liabilities .  As rates increased, S&Ls’ existing mortgage portfolio s decreased in value, because of  their 
fixed rates .  At the same time, S&Ls were forced to pay higher rates on their liabilities .  This situation 
threatened their continued viability.    - 8 - 
weaknesses.  For instance, Congress and the states reduced restrictions on S&Ls’  ability 
to invest in commercial and consumer loans .11  These changes contributed to the boom in 
commercial real estate lending, which  became a key source of  vulnerability.  In addition, 
Congress and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the federal S&L regulator at the time, 
weaken ed capital requirements and the  enforcement of those requirements for the S&L 
sector .12  This allow ed institutions to become weaker and poorly capitalized entities to 
stay afloat , leaving S&Ls  as a whole badly positioned to weather adverse conditions.  
The bust, when it came, was severe.   S&L losses continued to mount throughout 
the 1980s.  Many banks also experienced severe stress.  These difficulties  were amplified 
by an eventual decline in real estate values and problems in the agricultural and energy sectors.   In 1980, there were just under 4,000 S&Ls.  By 1989, that  number had fallen to 
below 3,000, with over  500 of the remaining institutions  insolvent as judged by book 
value.  And over 1,600 banks failed between 1980 and 1994.  Regulatory weakening had 
propped up tottering institutions , allowing zombie institutions  to persist, accumulating 
much greater losses  than they otherwise would have .  The process of cleaning up t he 
sector  began in earnest in the late 1980s  and continued into the mid -1990s , with a  final 
 
11 Many states simultaneously relaxed their own activities restrictions for state charters to allow for real 
estate investment . 
12 For instance, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board reduced net worth requirements for federally insured 
S&Ls  to allow troubled S&Ls to avoid closure and hopefully recover once interest rates declined.    - 9 - 
cost of  $160  billion , roughly 5 percent  of gross domestic product at the time .13  And t he 
cost of resolving insured banks  that failed during this period was $36 billion.14   
Congress implemented significant reforms  in response to th e S&L crisis, 
including stricter capital and accounting requirements, limit s on insured depository 
institutions’ investment powers, and expansions of  regulators’ enforcement authority.  
These changes paved the way for stability in the banking sector  for some time .   
The Global Financial Crisis  
I’ll turn now to my final example, the Global Financial Crisis , which  had 
devastating effects for the millions of people who lost their livelihoods, their homes , and 
their businesses .   
In the decade leading up to the crisis, America experienced rapid credit growth 
and a housing boom.  There was optimism about the benefits of financial innovation, 
such as securitization of home loans, and belief in the power  of market discipline as  a 
form of self -regulation.  Home prices and mortgage debt accelerated in tandem, driven by 
a mutually reinforcing cycle of optimism, with home prices roughly doubling between 1997 and 2006, and even larger increases in mortgage debt .
15  Amid this boom, l ending  
standards dropped, driven by investor demand for mortgage -backed securities, which

were increasingly opaque and risky in their design but still highly rated by the  rating 
agencies.  T here was substantial growth in the over -the-counter (OTC) derivatives 
market, including new forms of credit derivatives .  Money market funds boomed, 
becoming increasingly linked to the off -balance sheet business of banks.16  These 
developments led to the emergence of large, short -funded, and interconnected financial 
entities —both banks and nonbanks. 
The regulatory environment failed to keep up with the se changes in activity and 
the increasing complexity of financial institutions and markets , and regulatory weakening 
heightened vulnerabilities.  The Gramm- Leach -Bliley Act, enacted in 1999, permitted the 
creation of financial holding c ompanies that could engage in the full range of financial 
activities ; however, the act  did not put in place a regulatory framework commensurate 
with the full range of financial risks and permitted nonbank firms  such as investment 
banks and insurance conglomerates  to compete with banks  whol ly outsi de its framework.  
The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 exempted OTC derivatives 
transactions from virtually all regulation and oversight by the C ommodit y Future s 
Trading Commission  and SEC .  
In the lead -up to the crisis, regulators cut oversight further.  A striking image from 
the time featured the head of one financial regulatory agency wielding a chainsaw  to 
 
16 For example, many banks created asset -backed commercial paper  (ABCP) programs as conduit s that 
allowed them to fund bank assets without bringing them on balance sheet, thereby avoiding regulatory 
capital treatment.  However, this approach created significant risks because the primary holders of ABCP 
were money market mutual funds, which are ul tra-sensitive to payment delays and themselves subject to 
run risk.   Money market funds also  similarly  funded other parts of  banks’ balance sheets in the lead -up to 
the crisis.  In addition, other private cash -like instruments, such as auction rate securities, repurchase 
agreements based on ABCP, and other short -term debt instruments that were treated like money created 
new vulnerabilities as they grew and subsequently collapsed.    - 11 - 
demonstrate his commitment to slashing regulations.17  The competitive landscape and 
regulatory lacuna led to a race to the bottom in standards for underwriting and issuing 
mortgage loans and securities,  and transactions became increasingly funded by opaque  
and unstable  short -term wholesale funding.  Consumers were left unprotected as the 
subprime crisis grew.   In addition, the largest investment banks, which were overseen by 
the SEC, increased  their leverage with heavy reliance  on short -term funding, leaving 
them increasingly vulnerable to any losses.  These are just a few examples of the 
widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision that occurred  in both the 
banking and nonbanking  sectors in the lead -up to the crisis .   
The resulting recession and financial crisis saw the deepest and longest 
contraction in economic activity since the second world war , the collapse of large 
financial institution s, significant government support to keep the financial system  afloat, 
and a prolonged period of slow growth.   
In response to this  crisis , Congress  passed  the Dodd- Frank Act , a reform package 
that, among other things,  strengthened bank capital, addressed  off-balance sheet 
exposures, and provided for stress testing.   Consumer protections were strengthened, and 
a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was established.  Supervisors ramped up  
forward -looking supervision.  In addition, banking regulators adopted capital and 
liquidity reforms, which substantially improved the resiliency of the banking sector.   
Studying t he role that regulatory weakening played in the crisis provides  a powerful  
reminder of the importance of preserving these regulatory gains .

Lessons for Policymakers 
Reviewing these three examples together, it is striking to see the  pattern of 
regulatory weakening during a  boom , including the  failure of the regulatory environment 
to keep pace with the evolving financial sector, and how this weakening lays the 
foundation for a  subsequent  bust.  Why do we continue to see these cycles? 
Some reasons are psychological , others political .  Humans have short memories, 
especially for experiences we might like to forget.  The further we get from a crisis, the more its causes fade from memory and the less likely a recurrence seems.  W e become  
more likely to view regulations as unduly burdensome  and place less value on the 
protection they offer from downside risk .  The financial sector itself lobbies hard to 
weaken regulation , which is  often effective when the last crisis seems far away .   
Credit cycles, financial innovation, and the evolving needs of the economy are 
also significant contributor s.  As the economy changes, so do financing needs .  This 
makes it harder to recognize when things are running too hot .  In addition, regulators are 
understandably cautious about restraining innovations that have societal benefits, which may hinder their ability to reduce  associated risks .  Longstanding regulations can be 
subject to regulatory arbitrage, making them less effective as activities migrate  outside 
the regulated system .  These dynamic s make the financial sector unstable , feeding the 
boom -and-bust cycle.   
How can we do better?  
The first lesson  is to approach the financial system with a through- the-cycle 
perspective  and avoid thinking “this time is different.”   In each of the booms I have 
covered, there was a heady confidence that market discipline would control risk -taking ,  - 13 - 
that downside risks were so implausible as not to merit attention,  and that easi ng 
regulation was justified .  With such confidence, insufficient  thought was given to how 
regulatory weakening might create new vulnerabilities .  A bit of humility would have 
helped.  While it is true that regulation must evolve with  the economy and financial 
system , we need to recognize that relaxing rules can create vulnerabilities .  Changes in 
the markets themselves can also weaken the effectiveness of regulations .    
The second lesson is that policymakers  should resist the pressure to loosen 
regulations or to refrain from imposing regulation  on new activities during the boom 
times.  With past economic downturns in the rearview mirror, regulations start to be  seen 
as a limitation on growth, rather than necessary protecti on against vulnerabilities.   As 
became evident in past episodes, vigilant supervision and prudent rules on risk-taking are 
important  to prevent future crises .  While there is a tradeoff, it is important to have 
appropriate protections in place to reduce the risks and costs of  the resulting busts.   
Third , regulation cannot be static .  If regulation fails to keep up with evolution of 
the financial sector , it can create new risks or  hinder growth.  
To conclude, an important lesson  we can draw from U.S. financial crises is the 
role that ill -advised weakening of the bank regulatory framework played in those crises.  
It is well within our ability , and is our duty as regulators, to learn from these episodes to 
avoid making  the same mistakes.   In doing so, we can help to ensure that the financial  
system is prepared to weather downturns and continue to serve households and 
businesses.
