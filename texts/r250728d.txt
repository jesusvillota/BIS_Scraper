Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy  
 
Speech at a Meeting with Local Leaders in Kochi  
UCHIDA Shinichi  
Deputy Governor of the Bank  of Japan  
(English translation based on the Japanese original)  Bank of Japan  1 Introduction  
It is my pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with leaders in 
administrative, economic, and financial areas in Kochi  Prefecture. I would like to take this 
chance to express my sincere gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the Bank 
of Japan's Kochi  Branch.  Today, I will explain Japan's economic activity and prices, as well 
as the Bank's conduct of monetar y policy.  
 
I. Current  Situation of  and Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices  
I will start by talking about developments in economic activity and prices.  Please take a 
look at Chart 1. Japan's economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has 
been seen in part.  As for the outlook, Japan's economic growth is likely to moderate  due to  
the effects of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction . Thereafter, however, the growth 
rate is likely to rise, with overseas economies returning to a moderat e growth path.  That 
said, there are extremely high uncertainties regarding the future course of trade and other 
policies in each jurisdiction and the impact of these policies on economic activity and prices 
at home and abroad. The outlook I just explain ed is developed based on assumptions 
including the following: negotiations between jurisdictions will progress to some extent, 
and significant disruptions of global supply chains will be avoided.  
 
Considering this, I would like to explain  three key factors in  projecting future developments 
in Japan's economy: (1) trade policy in each jurisdiction and its impact on the global 
economy ; (2) the impact of such trade policy  on Japan's economy ; and (3) the rise in 
consumer prices, including food prices, and developm ents in private consumption.  
 
Trade Policy in Each Jurisdiction and the Global Economy  
Please refer to Chart 2. Since early spring of this year, the environment surrounding 
economic activity and financial markets at home and abroad has been changing 
significantly due to the series of tariff policies introduced by the United States.  International 
organizations  have significantly revised their economic projections downward. That said , at 
present, while deterioration in economic indicators worldwide has been seen mainly in soft 
data, including confidence indicators, hard data -- such as economic growth rate s and 2 employment indicators -- have not deteriorated as much , reflecting factors such as 
front -loading  due to the increase in U.S. tariff s. 
 
Please refer to Chart 3. In the United States , the increase in tariffs is likely to push up 
consumer prices through a rise in import prices, while in the real economy, it is likely to push 
down firms' and households' spending by way of elevated inflation a nd heightened 
uncertainties. Looking at the upper left-hand graph , business sentiment in the United States 
(red line and green dotted line) has deteriorated somewhat since the announcement of new 
tariffs . Moreover, consumer sentiment (blue line) has deteri orated substantially, mainly due 
to growing concerns over future inflation.  
 
Turning to the upper right -hand  graph, while the impact of tariff hikes on consumer prices 
has been limited on the whole so far , the prices of some goods for which the United States  
is heavily dependent on imports -- such as household electrical appliances, furniture,  and 
toys -- have risen . On this point, U.S. imports  increased rapidly in the first quarter of 2025, 
as shown in the lower  left-hand  graph. Since it is possible that many products currently on 
sale in the United States were imported before the tariffs were imposed, close examination 
of price developments over the next few months  is warranted , as is examination of  the 
impact on private consumption an d other factors if prices increase.  
 
Meanwhile, looking at the lower  right -hand graph, the U.S. unemployment rate (red line) 
has been more or less flat, at around  4 percent. This likely reflects the recent decline in the 
labor force participation rate (blue line). While U.S. labor market indicators have a tendency 
to fluctuate and thus require further monitoring , labor supply has weakened , possibly  
affected by the change in U.S. immigration policy. Labor market conditions have remained 
tight, but wages are unlikely to come  under strong upward pressure, since  labor demand has 
weakened , as seen in the number of newly employed persons . 
 
With regard to future developments , the main  scenario is that tightness in U.S. labor market 
conditions will gradually  ease as labor demand sees a moderate deceleration , generally in 
line with the deceleration  in labor supply. In this case, it is unlikely for second -round 
inflationary effects to be exerted through wage increases. On the other hand , if consumer 3 prices rise substantially due to the impact of tariff hikes and labor market conditions remain 
tight, the risk of inflation will be of concern.  Conversely , if labor market conditions 
deteriorate considerably, policy responses  are likely to  take account  of a potential economic 
slowdown.  Therefore, developments in consumer prices and labor market conditions  over 
the next few months  are key in assessing the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve's 
conduct of monetary policy . In addition, these developments are likely to affect global 
financial and capital markets, including the foreign exchange market.  
 
Meanwhile, t he Chinese economy has continued to show relatively high growth, mainly due 
to the effects of government measures, including subsidies to promote purchasing  of 
durable goods , and to the  front -loading of exports. However, these positive effects are 
expected to wane, and  issues such as sluggishness in the real estate market and the high 
youth unemployment rate have persisted . Moreover , with the Chinese economy initially  
facing the issue of structural excess production , there are Japanese firms that have shown  
concern that the condition of international commodity markets , including the prices of basic 
materials in Asian market s, may deteriorate  due to exports  from China . 
 
European economies have been relatively weak , with a deterioration in consumer sentiment 
and a reactionary decline in exports following front -loading . Meanwhile , there have  been  
some strong developments, such as a recovery in global d emand for IT -related goods , 
mainly led by AI -related products . It seems that an increasing number of experts  are 
viewing developments in other IT-related goods  somewhat cautiously , as front -loading for 
these goods  has likely paused, although these views  may change  depend ing on future 
developments in tariffs . 
 
As I just explained, among recent developments in the global economy, while the impact of 
tariffs on confidence indicators  can be observed , assessing hard data is difficult given , for 
example,  the timing of front -loading and the reactionary decline.  Going forward , I believe 
close attention is warranted on the direct impact via trade and the impact of deteriorating 
sentiment on business fixed investment and private consumption.  
 4 Trade Policy in Each Jurisdiction and Japan's Economy  
Next, I will talk about the impact  on Japan's economy. Please take a look at Chart 4 . The 
results of the  June 2025  Tankan  (Short -Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) 
released by the Bank on July 1  indicate that business sentiment has deteriorated in some 
manufacturing industries, mainly due to the impact of U.S. tariff policy, but has stayed at a 
favorable level overall.  
 
Moving on to Chart 5 , corporate profits have continued on an uptrend regardless of industry 
and firm size . Looking at the  right -hand table , manufacturing firms  have revised their profit 
projections for fiscal 2025  downward , expecting a decline of 8.4 percent.  However, 
nonmanufacturing firms , which have not been affected as much by the trade policies , have 
revised their profit projections for fiscal 2025 upward, and the profit levels of 
manufacturing firms through fiscal 2024 had been high . Therefore,  projected profits in the 
corporate sector overall have continued to be at  a relatively high level, with the projected 
decline of 5.7 percent in fiscal 2025 close to the increase of 5.6 percent in fiscal 2024.  
 
Please refer to Chart 6. Business fixed investment  has continued on a moderate increasing 
trend, and this fiscal year's investment plans in the left -hand graph indicate that this trend 
will be maintained. The right -hand graph shows developments in machinery orders and 
construction starts, which are leading indicators of business fixed investment. These 
indicators have also continued to show an increasing trend and there seems to be no 
significant change in firms' appetite for investment  at this stage . Of course, with extremely 
high uncertainties regarding trade and other policies, many  exporting firms may have put 
off revising  their business fixed investment plan s. That said, there have been many reports 
from firms in a wide range of industries that they consider labor -saving and 
efficiency -improving investment to be essential given intensifying labor shortages,  and that 
they plan to  steadily move forward with the investments they deem necessary from a 
medium- to long -term perspective,  such as  invest ments for digitalization and 
decarbonization , regardless of how tariff policies unfold.  
 
Chart 7  illustrates the  employment and income situation. Looking at the final aggregate 
results of annual spring labor -management wage negotiations -- presented in the  upper 5 left-hand graph -- this year's agreed wage growth rate was 5.25 percent, which was 
somewhat higher than last year and the highest level in 34 years. Developments by firm size 
and type of employment -- presented in the lower  left-hand table -- show  that the wage 
growth rate for unions that have 99 or less members has increased  the mos t from the 
previous year . Moreover, t he results of other surveys -- such as those conducted by  the 
Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry -- indicate  that micro, small , and medium -sized 
firms , which are facing severe labor shortages, plan to conduct wage hikes similar to or 
somewhat higher than those in fiscal 2024 , with some raising wages as a defensive step. 
Therefore, the impact of tariff policies do es not seem to have been  significant  at the time of  
this year's annual spring labor -management wage negotiations . 
 
Reflecting such high wage growth rates, scheduled cash earnings -- presented in the 
right -hand graph -- have continued to be on a clear increas ing trend , albeit with fluctuations 
due to the number of working days and other factors. Meanwhile, the number of employed 
persons has continued to increase steadily,  mainly in the information and communications 
industry and in the medical, healthcare, and welfare serv ices industry, both of which have 
faced severe labor shortages. Against this backdrop, employee income -- which is the 
product of wages per employee and the number of employed persons -- has continued to see 
a relatively high year -on-year increase, and is currently at around 4 percent.  
 
Thus, although  tariff policies are expected to have a negative impact , the business plans  of 
Japanese firms assume  that profits will remain at a high level, albeit with a decline, and that 
they will continue with fixed investment and human capital investment.  
 
That said, future developments require attention . The course of tariff negotiations between 
jurisdictions remains  uncertain  and firms have yet to deal with their effects . Regarding 
Japan's economy as a whole, I think  that (1) the baseline  scenario  is that economic growth 
will moderate temporarily , as I mentioned at the outset,  amid  a slowdown in overseas 
economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits and other factors , and (2) there are 
high uncertainties over Japan's economy and risks are skewed to the downside . 
 6 The direct impact of U.S. tariff hikes on Japanese firms is likely to first appear in export 
profitability or export volume , depend ing on whether the firms  pass on the increased costs 
due to the tariffs to selling prices in the United States.  Looking at  Chart 8,  export prices , 
especially those  of passenger cars  to North America , have clearly fallen since April this year. 
That said, as transactions observed at this point seem to have been mainly between parent 
companies in Japan and their sales subsidiaries in the United States , the actual  selling prices 
of subsidiaries will be determined by  factors such as the future competitive environment in 
the U.S. markets . As such , Japanese firms' export and sales strategies  and the magnitude of 
the impact on their profits  will depend, for example, on the specific tariff rate levels and 
how firms in other jurisdictions  will react . 
 
Considering these factors  on the assum ption  that negotiations between jurisdictions will 
progress to some extent , profits in the corporate sector overall wi ll continue to be at  a high 
level , even if exporters' profits are pushed down , as shown in the June 2025 Tankan . With 
regard to wage -setting, the baseline  scenario is that, since  an acute sense of labor shortage 
will persist , the recent trend of firms actively raising wages and prices  will continue . 
 
However , if the negative impact of tariff policies turns out to be greater or more prolonged 
than expected, there is concern  that the trend of wage hikes observed over the past few 
years could weaken through , for example, greater pressure on domestic supply chains in 
export industries to reduce costs  or adverse effects  on private consumption  and the 
nonmanufacturing sector . Considering the extremely high uncertainties regarding 
developments in the global economy and global financial and capital markets, close 
attention is warranted on such downside risks to Japan's economic activity and prices.  
 
Moreover, future economic developments  concerning these points will vary across 
industries, firms, and regions , and such developments  cannot be fully understood using 
macro  data alone. In particular, the Bank , through dialogue with business managers,  aims to  
carefully gauge  in a timely manner  how these uncertainties will affect firms' 
decision -making , such as about invest ment . I would thus like to ask you all for your 
continued cooperation in, for example, interviews conducted by the Bank's branches.  
 7 Developments in Consumer Prices and Private Consumption  
I would now like to discuss the third factor, which is developments in prices and private 
consumption. Please refer to Chart 9. As presented in the left -hand graph, consumer 
sentiment in Japan has recently deteriorated, mainly against the background of a rise in food 
prices, such as rice prices, and uncertainties regarding tariff policies. The right -hand graph 
shows developments in  real private consumption. Consumption of nondurable goods (green 
dotted line) including food has continued on a decreasing trend, reflecting consumers' 
increased thriftiness, mainly due to the rise in food prices. On the whole, however, private 
consumptio n (red line) has maintained a moderate increasing trend, supported by an 
improvement in the employment and income situation. Regarding the outlook, since wage 
increases are expected to continue, as I explained earlier, their developments relative to 
price increases will be important.  
 
Please take a look at Chart 10. The year -on-year rate of change in the consumer price index 
(CPI, all items less fresh food) -- represented by the red line -- was in the range of 3.0-3.5 
percent for June 2025. The main reason behind inflation in recent years is the increase in 
food prices (light blue bars). The first increase was seen from 2022 through 2023, led by a 
rise in import prices. Although it paused in the first half of last year, food prices have 
increased again since  the second half of last year, mainly due to the rise in rice prices.  
 
Meanwhile, the year -on-year rate of increase in services prices (pink bars) rose through 
2023, and thereafter has been more or less flat. Wage increases have continued to push up 
services prices  -- although the pace has not accelerated  -- as a moderate underlying trend.  
 
Looking ahead, the Bank expects the impact of higher rice prices and other cost -push 
factors to eventually wane, partly owing to various government measures. Meanw hile, 
underlying inflation excluding cost -push factors is determined by the output gap, which 
captures the utilization of labor and capital in the overall economy, and by medium - to 
long-term inflation expectations, which indicate firms' and households' vi ews on prices over 
a somewhat longer horizon . 
 8 Please refer to Chart 11. As shown in the left -hand graph, the output gap (red line) is 
currently at around zero percent . Since the actual growth rate of Japan's economy is 
projected to remain roughly in line with the potential growth rate for the time being, it is 
likely that the gap will remain at around the current level. Thereafter, it will improve again 
as the actual growth rate rises. Meanwhile, labor shortages have intensified, partly due to a 
decelerati on in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, 
which has supported labor supply to date. There have also been cases where, due to labor 
shortages, firms -- particularly in nonmanufacturing industries, such as accommodations a s 
well as eating and drinking services -- are unable to raise their capacity utilization rates 
even when their facilities are underutilized, which I believe is also being observed in Kochi 
Prefecture. In this sense, upward pressure on wages and prices coul d be stronger than 
suggested by the output gap.  
 
Moreover, the upper right -hand graph shows that medium - to long -term inflation 
expectations have risen moderately in recent years, with firms' behavior  shifting more 
toward raising wages and prices. This trend is expected to continue going forward, although 
the pace is likely to be sluggish due to deceleration in the economy, and then to increase 
again. After the turn of this fiscal year, price hikes hav e spread from rice to other food 
products as well, and consumer prices have risen by  more than what the Bank or market 
participants had expected.  This suggests that, at least with regard to food prices, firms' 
price -setting behavior has changed significant ly compared to the past. As similar trends can 
be seen in related areas, such as dining -out, the Bank will monitor the extent of these 
developments. After all, since food products are closely tied to daily life and purchased 
frequently, they are likely to have a relatively  strong er influence on people's views on prices. 
While it is difficult to observe medium - to long -term inflation expectations directly, since 
the past few years have been a period of major change, the Bank will carefully gauge these 
develo pments , including  micro-level changes in corporate behavior.  
 
Please look at the lower right -hand table. In sum, the Bank's outlook for prices is as follows. 
The effects of the rise in food prices are expected to wane. Underlying inflation is likely to 
be sluggish temporarily, mainly because economic growth is likely to moderate due to the 
effects of trade policy in each jurisdiction. The year -on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all 9 items less fresh food) could fall below 2 percent at some point through fi scal 2026. 
Thereafter, actual inflation and underlying inflation are both expected to increase gradually, 
since  it is likely that, in line with the increase in the economic growth rate, tightness in labor 
market conditions will become more evident, and a g rowing number of firms will shift their 
behavior more toward raising wages and prices . The Bank expects to achieve the price 
stability target of 2 percent sometime during the second half of the projection period of its 
latest Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices  -- namely, the period from the second half 
of fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2027.  
 
II. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy  
Future Conduct of Monetary Policy  
Next, I will discuss the Bank's conduct of monetary policy.  
 
As I have already explained, amid a slowdown in overseas economies, it is likely that 
Japan's economic growth will moderate and underlying inflation will be sluggish 
temporarily. In addition, given that there remain extremely high uncertainties regarding t he 
trade policy of each jurisdiction and its effects on domestic and overseas economies , risks to 
economic activity and prices are both skewed to the downside.  In light of these points, it is 
important to firmly support economic activity by maintaining acc ommodative financial 
conditions . At the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held last month , the Bank decided to 
keep  the policy interest rate unchanged at 0.5 percent . Please refer to Chart 12. As shown in 
the left -hand graph, the real interest rate -- calculated as the nominal interest rate minus the 
expected rate of inflation -- is significantly negative. Moreover, as shown in the right -hand 
graph, the Tankan  results in dicate that financial institutions have continued to take an active 
lending stance, and that issuance conditions for corporate bonds have remained favorable on 
the whole. Japan's financial conditions have been accommodative.  
 
As for the future conduct of m onetary policy, given that real interest rates are at 
significantly low levels, if the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic 
activity and prices is realized, the Bank, in accordance with improvement in economic 
activity and prices, w ill continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of 
monetary accommodation.  10 In this regard, the Bank will examine whether the outlook will be realized, without any 
preconceptions. As I have explained, it is not entirely clear how trade negotiations between 
jurisdictions will evolve ; it is also not entirely  clear  from each jurisdiction's economic data 
to date  how economic activity and prices at home and abroad, as well as global financial 
and capital markets , will develop. I would like to  pay close attention to these factors , as 
there are extremely high uncertainties and as domestic and overseas economies seem to be 
at a critical juncture. These factors also have the risk of  putting downward pressure on 
prices in Japan. On the other hand, there has been upward pressure from cost -push factors, 
especially for food prices. My attention will therefore be on how such upward and 
downward pressure may affect the outlook for prices through, for example, firms' wage - and 
price -setting behavior.  
 
Under the premise that the outlook for economic activity and prices comes with uncertainty, 
the Bank needs to adjust monetary policy  to best balance the upside and downside risks 
from the perspective of maintaining stability in economic activity and prices. T his is called 
the risk -management approach, and the Bank aims to take this kind of orthodox and robust 
monetary policy  approach , especially now when uncertainties are extremely high.  
 
Plan for the Reduction of the Purchase Amount of Japanese Government Bon ds 
Please refer to Chart 13. I would now like to talk about the Bank's purchases of Japanese 
government bonds (JGBs). Under large -scale monetary easing conducted from 2013, the 
Bank had purchased large amounts of JGBs from the market to stabilize the entir e yield 
curve at a low level. It concluded this policy framework last year, and has been reducing its 
purchase amount of JGBs in a planned manner. Specifically, the Bank decided to reduce the 
amount of its monthly outright purchases, which had been close t o 6 trillion yen, by about 
400 billion yen each calendar quarter through March 2026.  
 
Please take a look at Chart 14. The Bank's plan for the reduction of the purchase amount of 
JGBs is based on the idea that, in principle, long -term interest rates are to be formed in 
financial markets. The move is thus aimed at reducing the Bank's market presence, which 
had increased substantially as a result of large -scale monetary easing, and thereby 
improving the functioning of the JGB markets. The functioning of the JG B markets has 11 actually been improving as the Bank makes headway in reducing its JGB purchase amount. 
This can be seen, for example, in the increase in the transaction volume for cash JGBs -- as 
presented in the left -hand graph -- particularly for on -the-run issues, and in the fact that 
JGB yields -- as presented in the right -hand graph -- are moving more in line with various 
economic indicators, market participants' views on future monetary policy, and 
developments in overseas interest rates. That said, as the Bank's JGB holdings have 
remained substantial, market participants and many others have continued to express the 
view that improvement in market functioning is still only halfway accomplished and thus 
there is considerable room for further progress.  
 
Let me go back to Chart 13. Taking this view of market participants into account, at the 
MPM held last month, the Bank decided on a new reduction plan for JGB purchases 
through March 2027. Specifically, it will continue to reduce the monthly purchase amount  
by about 400 billion yen each calendar quarter through March 2026, in line with the 
previous plan, and from April 2026 onward, will moderate the pace of reduction to about 
200 billion yen each calendar quarter. As a result, flow -based monthly purchases in  
January -March 2027 will be about 2 trillion yen, which is equivalent to about one -third of 
monthly purchases before the start of reductions.  
 
As I mentioned earlier, in principle, long -term interest rates are to be formed in financial 
markets, and to further advance this, it is desirable for the Bank to continue reducing its 
purchase amount of JGBs. On the other hand, if the pace of reduction is  too fast, this may 
have an unforeseen impact on market stability. Notably, JGB purchases and the holdings of 
market participants will increase in terms of both flow and stock as the reduction of the 
Bank's purchase amount moves forward . Given this, the Ba nk decided that it was 
appropriate to slow the pace of reduction, taking into account market participants' views. In 
addition, the plan decided at the June 2025 MPM continues to allow enough flexibility to 
support stability in the JGB markets. That is to s ay, if an exceptional case, such as a rapid 
rise in long -term interest rates, should take place, the Bank will make nimble responses by, 
for example, increasing the amount of JGB purchases. It will also conduct an interim 
assessment of the new reduction pl an at the June 2026 MPM while reviewing the 12 developments in and functioning of the JGB markets. If deemed necessary, the Bank may 
modify the plan as appropriate.  
 
The large -scale monetary easing conducted from 2013, combined with government 
measures, clear ed the personnel surplus that was at the root of the deflationary economy, 
and labor shortages are currently a driving force behind changes in corporate behavior and 
in Japan's economic structure. I believe large -scale monetary easing was a necessary polic y 
for Japan's economy. On the other hand, there is no such thing as a free lunch, and the 
overall effect of the easing on Japan's  economy will not be definite until the exit process is 
complete. I believe i t can be judged that the easing had positive effec ts on Japan's economy 
only after t he Bank makes a successful exit.  
 
Restoring interest rate formation to the original state where rates are determined by the 
market requires predictability. On the other hand, there is no precedent for the current 
situation, in which the Bank must normalize policy from the state during the yield curve 
control  period , when  it had an overwhelming presence in the JGB markets. A certain degree 
of flexibility to prepare for unexpected developments is essential t o avoid causing a 
situation where rapid interest rate fluctuations adversely affect ec onomic activity and prices . 
Similarly, the Bank has taken various measures to strike the right balance from an early 
stage, such as expanding the range of 10 -year JGB yield fluctuations under yield curve 
control. While these efforts have sometimes been sai d to be ambiguous or difficult to 
understand, they have , after all,  allowed the Bank to proceed with normalization while 
maintaining market stability. Going forward, the Bank will continue to aim to understand 
developments in the JGB markets as accurately as possible through its operations and 
through dialogue with market participants, and to take appropriate steps to bring the 
markets closer to their original state.  
 
It should be noted  that, in designing policy  measures , the Bank is paying close attention to 
the potential adverse effects of rapid interest rate fluctuations on economic activity and 
prices . It goes without saying that the aim is not to support the financing of the government . 
The Bank decided at the June 2025 MPM to slow the pace of reduction  and to maintain a 
mechanism that allows for flexibility , from such a perspective . 13 III. Economy of Kochi Prefecture  
In closing, I would like to talk about the economy of Kochi Prefecture. Please take a look at 
Chart 15.  
 
The share of manufacturing in the p refectural economy has been low compared with other 
prefectures, while the share of services, construction, and other nonmanufacturing has been 
high, yielding an industrial structure supported by domestic demand. For this reason, the 
direct impact on Kochi  Prefecture's economy of trade and other policies abroad has so far 
been limited, and the economy has continued to pick up gradually as domestic demand, 
including private consumption, has been firm. Tourism demand is expected to increase this 
year, partly due to the broadcast of a television drama series set in the prefecture.  
 
That said, looking at Kochi Prefecture's economy from a longer -term perspective, the 
population is declining at a faster pace than the national average -- as indicated in the 
left-hand graph -- and the prefecture faces the threat of natural disasters, such  as a massive 
earthquake in the Nankai Trough off the Pacific coast. On this point, the local government 
has positioned the issue of population decline as its top priority in the Kochi Prefecture 
Strategy for Creating a Vibrant Future, formulated in March  2024. This strategy includes 
efforts to raise the income of young people through industrial development and to promote 
sharing in childcare and housework between the genders. In the strategy revision for fiscal 
2025, the prefecture has adopted pioneering a pproaches to population decline, including 
measures to ensure sustainable public services. Moreover, to prepare for a potential Nankai 
Trough earthquake, the prefecture has made steady progress in, for example, making homes 
earthquake -resistant, constructi ng tsunami evacuation towers, and implementing triple 
defense measures against tsunamis at Urado Bay.  
 
Population decline and disaster prevention are major issues that Japan as a whole must 
address. Thus, Kochi Prefecture 's unique and ambitious initiatives  will serve as an 
important guidepost for the entire country  if realized . I would like to conclude my remarks 
by expressing my hope that Kochi Prefecture will become a model for a sustainable 
regional community.  Thank you very much for your attention.  July 23, 2025
