1/6 BIS - Central bankers' speechesJosé Luis Escrivá: The future of the European financial system
Speech by Mr José Luis Escrivá, Governor of the Bank of Spain, at a forum, organised 
by Elkargi, Bilbao, 10 July 2025.

It is a true pleasure to be here today at this forum organised by Elkargi. I would 
particularly like to thank Elkargi's Chair, Lander Arteche, and General Manager, Zenón 
Vázquez, for their kind invitation.
Events like this are an opportunity to share reflections and, above all, to listen. To listen 
to those who best understand the reality of the productive system, the challenges of 
accessing finance and the opportunities that emerge in an environment of change.
And if anything defines the present moment, it is precisely that: change. Change that is 
far-reaching, swift and, in many respects, uncertain. Against this backdrop, talking 
about the future of the European financial system is more than a theoretical exercise: 
it's a discussion about how we are going to finance and sustain growth, innovation and 
social cohesion in Europe in the coming decades.
That's why today I'd like to share a few thoughts on how we can build a European 
financial system that is stronger, more integrated and better equipped for the 
challenges of the 21st century.
As has been evident for some time, the international environment facing Europe has 
become more complex and, in many respects, more adverse.
Geopolitical fragmentation, with the emergence of blocs vying for technological, trade 
and military hegemony, is undermining the multilateral order that has underpinned 
European prosperity for decades. This is compounded by rising levels of armed conflict, 
which, aside from its tragic consequences, have direct repercussions on trade flows, 
global value chains and, of course, the international financial system.
All of which generates a climate of deep uncertainty, one that is proving persistent and 
appears somewhat structural.
Against this backdrop, Europe – with its significant external dependencies in energy, 
technology and finance – has grown more vulnerable. Add to this rapid technological 
change – spearheaded by the United States and China – and demographic decline, and 
the urgency of a strategic response becomes all the more evident.
In the face of this increasingly complex and uncertain world, Europe needs to articulate 
a clear, ambitious and cohesive strategic response. It is not a question of raising 
barriers or retracting from the world, but of strengthening our economic and 
technological foundations in order to project ourselves more robustly on the 
international stage.2/6 BIS - Central bankers' speechesDoing so means placing the internal market at the core of our growth strategy, providing 
a resolute boost to productivity, accelerating the technological transformation and 
decarbonisation and reinforcing our economic and defence sovereignty.
Competitiveness is, without question, the central pillar of this agenda. To advance it 
effectively, coordinated action between European institutions and Member States is 
essential. The cornerstones of this agenda include:
Strengthening the internal market, removing the barriers that prevent European 
firms from growing and scaling up.
Simplifying the regulatory frameworks that affect firms.
Coordinating trade, industrial and competition policies, ensuring a framework 
conducive to the development of strategic industries.
Developing a robust defence industry that advances the European Union's (EU) 
strategic autonomy.
Diversified, efficient and resilient financing.
Government investment is fundamental to driving this agenda forward, as a means of 
equipping Europe with the infrastructure and public goods that this transformation 
demands, as well as mobilising private investment and generating a multiplier effect on 
the economy as a whole. In particular, EU-wide public goods – such as cross-border 
energy grids, common digital platforms and shared defence capabilities – are key to 
reinforcing the EU's cohesion, competitiveness and strategic autonomy.
At the heart of the European competitiveness strategy lie small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs), the true backbone of our continent's productive system. They 
account for more than 75% of jobs and over 50% of value added in the EU's non-
financial private sector. These figures are higher still in Spain.1
Yet the true importance of SMEs goes beyond the quantitative metrics: they are also 
drivers of innovation. Indeed, many of the most disruptive start-ups emerge within this 
ecosystem. Their agility, creativity and customer proximity allow them to quickly identify 
opportunities and develop solutions.
However, if they are to establish themselves, scale up and compete in an increasingly 
demanding global environment, these firms need a framework that smooths access to 
the single market and appropriate sources of financing. Insufficient scale and financing 
remain structural barriers for many start-ups.
Against this background, the two legislative packages recently put forward by the 
European Commission – one focused on developing the single market and the other on 
supporting start-ups and scale-ups – represent significant steps forward. In particular, 
the proposal to create a "28th Regime" for innovative SMEs – enabling them to operate 
under an EU-wide framework – is a promising initiative that ought to be processed 
swiftly and decisively.
In countries such as Spain, where the average firm size is especially small,  these 2
measures could prove transformational.3/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches1.

3.  But if the economic transformation strategy is to be truly viable, Europe's financial 
system must be up to the challenge. This means having a financial architecture capable 
of effectively channelling resources where they are needed most.
However, there continue to be structural weaknesses in the European financial system 
that dampen its responsiveness:
Excessive fragmentation across national jurisdictions.
Heavy reliance on bank intermediation.
Shallow capital markets with little integration.
Overcoming these shortcomings is key if Europe is to maintain its strategic ambition. To 
this end, we must make headway towards a more cohesive, efficient and resilient 
financial system. A system underpinned by three core pillars:
The euro, as the cornerstone of the payments system and a strategic asset for 
European sovereignty.
A solid and competitive banking system.
Deep, integrated and accessible capital markets.
Allow me to begin with the first of these: the euro.
The euro is more than just a currency. First, it is a tool for developing European identity 
and economic sovereignty. The euro is currently the world's second most used currency 
and accounts for 20% of global currency reserves, compared with 58% for the dollar. 
Going forward, its global standing will largely depend on Europe's success in 
transitioning towards a more productive, competitive and autonomous economy.
The euro also serves as the backbone of the European payment system, a role that has 
been further strengthened by the advancements made in the Single Euro Payments 
Area (SEPA). However, 72% of retail card payments in Europe are still made using non-
European networks. This dependency is becoming entrenched with the emergence of 
new digital wallet providers and could be exacerbated by the expansion of dollar-
denominated stablecoins.
Against this backdrop, the digital euro project takes on a strategic dimension. As legal 
tender backed by the central bank and complementing cash, the digital euro could 
serve as a basis for private payment solutions while reducing external dependencies. It 
also presents an opportunity to consolidate SEPA and protect it against future risks.
In the wholesale arena, where a digital form of the euro is already in use, the challenge 
lies in adapting key infrastructures, such as TARGET (the European platform for 
secure, real-time settlements between central banks and commercial banks), to 
emerging technologies
such as tokenisation and distributed ledger technology. The aim here will be to ensure 
these infrastructures' interoperability with private platforms that use these technologies, 
thus improving the financial system's efficiency, transparency and security.4/6 BIS - Central bankers' speechesThe second pillar of our financial architecture is the banking system. In Europe, bank 
loans account for 92% of corporate finance, and this high concentration means that the 
banking system must be solid, competitive and resilient.
The Basel III regulatory reforms introduced in the wake of the global financial crisis 
have contributed decisively to strengthening the sector. Capital and liquidity ratios have 
improved substantially and European banks have proven notably resilient to recent 
crises, such as the pandemic and the energy crisis.
In parallel, the creation of the banking union, along with the Single Supervisory 
Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism, has been key to ensure financial 
stability in the euro area. The banking union, though, remains incomplete. There is a 
pressing need to move towards implementing a European deposit insurance scheme, 
which would help reduce national fragmentation and definitively sever the link between 
sovereign and bank risk.
Furthermore, cross-border mergers remain scarce and need to be facilitated. Such 
mergers would pave the way for banks that are more capable of funding Europe's key 
priorities (digitalisation and defence, for instance) and would help to reduce financial 
system fragmentation, improve the efficient allocation of capital across the continent 
and bolster resilience to economic shocks by diversifying geographical and operational 
risks.
Another key aspect is the regulatory framework. We need regulation that is not only 
strong, but also clear, simple and efficient. Simplification does not imply relaxing 
solvency or liquidity requirements, nor does it mean deregulation. It means reducing 
unnecessary complexities, eliminating overlaps and building a more predictable and 
consistent legislative environment.
This will entail a comprehensive review of European rules (including Level 2 and Level 
3), to avoid overlaps and update reporting requirements by eliminating those that are 
now obsolete. In short, we will need a holistic and integrated view of regulation, to 
enable banks to operate more effectively without compromising the system's stability.
Capital markets are the third pillar of our financial architecture. Developing and 
integrating Europe's capital markets is a prerequisite if we want to diversify financing 
sources, especially for SMEs.
As the representatives from Elkargi here with us well know, today SMEs rely almost 
entirely on bank loans for their financing. And while this has its advantages (in know-
your-customer aspects, for instance), it also makes them more vulnerable to banking 
sector shocks and changes in bank loan conditions.3
This is why we need to broaden and diversify the sources of corporate finance, which 
naturally brings us to the important task of deepening and integrating Europe's capital 
markets.5/6 BIS - Central bankers' speechesMaking headway with the capital markets union (recently reframed as the savings and 
investment union) is a financial priority and a core element of Europe's strategy to raise 
productivity, attract investment and strengthen its global competitiveness.
In this context, I would like to highlight two particularly significant initiatives:
First, the development of financing options for small innovative companies and start-
ups, particularly in their early stages. It is essential to facilitate early access to financing 
for these firms, whether through venture capital funds or similar arrangements, and 
support them in their subsequent growth. The aim of this is clear: to make sure that 
these firms can thrive in Europe and do not have to relocate to other, more favourable 
jurisdictions. Some European countries, such as Sweden, have successfully created 
dynamic financial ecosystems that can serve as reference for other Member States.
Second, the review of the securitisation framework, with a view to smoothing the 
transfer of risk (including that associated with loans to SMEs) to other financial system 
participants. The 2017 reform did not have the expected impact, and the European 
Commission has recently announced a new proposal to reduce operational costs and 
improve risk sensitivity. Aware of its potential for boosting lending to firms, the Banco de 
España is assessing this proposal with interest.
As we have seen, completing and integrating the capital markets is vital. Only thus will 
we be able to offer our firms, especially the most innovative and dynamic ones, a 
financial ecosystem that allows them to grow, compete and lead the economic 
transformation that Europe needs.
And this brings me to my concluding point.
Europe faces a crossroads. The global environment has changed and, with it, so have 
the rules of the game. But we are also faced with a historic opportunity to construct a 
stronger, more resilient and more autonomous economy. An economy capable of 
sustaining its citizens' social well-being and its geopolitical standing in an increasingly 
uncertain world.
To this end, Europe's financial system must be an active and key part of the solution. 
We are called to complete it, integrate it and equip it for the challenges of the 21st 
century. Only then will European firms, in particular our SMEs, be guaranteed the 
resources they need to grow, innovate and create quality employment.
At the Banco de España we will continue to work towards this objective. Because a 
strong financial system is not an end in itself; it is a tool for achieving economic 
progress and the well-being of European citizens.
