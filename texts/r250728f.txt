The RBA’s Dual Mandate – Inflation
and Employment
Michele Bullock
Governor
Anika Foundation Fundraising Lunch
Sydney – 24 July 2025
I’d like to begin by acknowledging the Traditional Custodians of the land on which we meet and pay my
respects to Elders past and present.
It’s an honour to join you today at the Anika Foundation fundraising lunch. The Foundation supports
vital work on youth mental health research, awareness and education, in which I have a strong
personal interest.
I’m proud to uphold the tradition of the Reserve Bank Governor speaking at this event to support an
organisation that is making a real difference.
My remarks today centre on the dual objectives of monetary policy: ‘price stability’, which means
maintaining low and stable inflation; and full employment, which I will talk about in more detail later.
I’ll explore how these aims have shaped the Monetary Policy Board’s strategy in recent years.  As part
of that, I will reflect on the relationship between the labour market and inflation over that time, and how
conditions in the labour market have evolved to the present day.
Now is a good time to revisit these subjects, following the agreement two weeks ago of an updatedStatement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy , which sets out the common understanding of Government
and the Board on key elements of the monetary policy framework.*

[
]But bef ore I turn to that, I’ ll start wi th an update on r ecent monetary pol icy set tings.
Recent monetary policy settings
If you cast y our mind back to 2022, y ou wi ll recall that inflation w as higher than i t had been in decades,
peaking at 7 .8 per cent at the end of that y ear. It w as this rise in inflation that r equired a tightening in
monetary pol icy over 2022 and 2023, wi th the cash r ate incr easing f rom almost z ero to 4 .35 per cent
over that period.
Over the past couple of y ears, we ha ve made meaningf ul progress in bringing inflation down. Higher
interest rates ha ve been working to bring aggr egate demand and supply closer tow ards balance. W e
expect headl ine inflation in the June quarter to be in the lower hal f of our 2–3 per cent  target range –
although that partly r eflects the ongoing ef fect of tempor ary cost -of-living r elief. As that ef fect un winds,
we expect headl ine inflation to pick up to ar ound the top of the band at the end of this y ear and into the
first part of 2026.
To help look thr ough tempor ary factors l ike this, we also pa y close at tention to trimmed mean inflation
(published quarterly), which pr ovides a good guide to underlying inflation tr ends.  This measur e has
also been easing, but i t’s still a bit higher than headl ine inflation. A t 2.9 per cent in the Mar ch quarter ,
year-ended trimmed mean inflation w as under 3 per cent f or the first time since 2021.
We expect trimmed mean inflation to f all a little further in the June quarter in y ear-ended terms.
Howev er, the monthly CPI I ndicator data, which ar e volatile, suggest that the f all may not be qui te as
much as we f orecast back in Ma y. We still think i t will show inflation decl ining slowly tow ards
2½ per cent, but we ar e looking f or data to support this expectation.
Encour agingly , as inflation has slowed, the labour mark et has eased only gr adual ly and the
unemplo yment r ate is r elatively low . I’ll have mor e to sa y on dev elopments in the labour mark et later .
Since F ebruary , we ha ve reduced the cash r ate by 50 basis points. The B oard continues to judge that a
measur ed and gr adual appr oach to monetary pol icy easing is appr opriate. Global economic and pol icy
developments ha ve so f ar been lar gely in l ine wi th our basel ine Ma y forecasts, and the l ikelihood of a
severe downside ‘tr ade w ar’ appears to ha ve diminished. B ut ther e is sti ll uncertaint y and
unpredictabi lity in the global econom y. The B oard’s view is that monetary pol icy is wel l placed to
respond decisiv ely to adv erse international dev elopments i f needed.3
 [

4
 [
]Our longstanding str ategy has been to bring inflation back to tar get whi le preserving as man y of the
gains in the labour mark et as possible. This appr oach meant that inter est rates in A ustralia did not rise
as high as they did in some other economies, and so we ma y not need to lower them as much on the
way down.
We also know that A ustralians continue to f eel cost -of-living pr essures, wi th the a verage lev el of prices
now notably higher than i t was just a f ew years ago . That is wh y we w ant to mak e sure that inflation
remains low and stable f rom her e on in. Low and stable inflation is good f or households, good f or jobs,
good f or communi ties and good f or the econom y.
Our goals of price stability and full employment generally
reinforce each other
Stepping back f rom curr ent pol icy set tings and the inflationary episode of r ecent y ears, I now w ant to
reflect on the f ramework that guides the B oard’s decisions mor e gener ally.
The RBA ’s monetary pol icy objectiv es are set out in legislation.  Our o verarching goal is to pr omote
the economic pr osperi ty and wel fare of the A ustralian people, both now and into the f uture. For
the Board, this means set ting monetary pol icy in a w ay that best achiev es both price stabi lity and
full emplo yment.
These goals ar e often r eferred to as our ‘dual mandate’ and ar e longstanding objectiv es of the RBA.
Over time, low and stable inflation and f ull emplo yment go hand in hand. Low and stable inflation – or
price stabi lity – is a pr erequisi te for str ong and sustainable emplo yment gr owth because i t creates
favourable condi tions f or households and businesses to plan, in vest and cr eate jobs wi thout ha ving to
worry about inflation.  So our two objectiv es are complementary o ver the longer term.
Even in the shorter term, the two objectiv es often go hand in hand. F or example, when ther e are ups
and downs in demand, inflation tends to rise as the labour mark et tightens, and f all as it loosens. S o a
monetary pol icy response that r eturns inflation to tar get wi ll, in time, also mo ve the labour mark et
towards full emplo yment.
But sometimes ther e are dev elopments that push up inflation at the same time as they weigh down
demand – and ther efore emplo yment. This includes sharp incr eases in ener gy prices and supply5
 [

 [
]disruptions that push up prices mor e broadly. As I’ ll discuss in a moment, such ‘negativ e supply shocks’
were part of the r eason f or the high inflation of r ecent y ears, though they wer e not the only f actor.
In the f ace of supply shocks that push up prices, we need to think about possible tr ade-of fs: how do we
balance our two goals in these cir cumstances?
If a supply disruption is tempor ary and modest, monetary pol icy should mostly ‘look thr ough’ i t. Raising
interest rates mak es little sense i f inflation is expected to ease once tempor ary supply disruptions ar e
resolved – i t would only weak en the job mark et.
By contr ast, when a supply shock is l ikely to ha ve a longer lasting ef fect on the econom y and inflation
there may be str onger gr ounds f or monetary pol icy to r espond.
A key concern her e is that the longer inflation sta ys high, the mor e households’ and businesses’
expectations f or future inflation could incr ease. This could, in turn, lead to second-r ound ef fects on
inflation as households and businesses bui ld higher expectations into their decisions.
But if households and businesses instead maintain a high lev el of confidence that the B oard will do what
is needed to r eturn inflation to tar get, inflationary shocks wi ll have less ef fect on price and w age set ting.
That means we can look thr ough adv erse supply shocks to a gr eater extent – ev en those that we think
could last f or some time.
This highl ights another important w ay in which our objectiv es are complementary – and i t’s something I
want to emphasise. Ha ving a str ong tr ack record of low and stable inflation puts us in the best possible
position to support emplo yment. It means ther e is less risk of inflation get ting out of contr ol, which
allows inflation to be br ought down wi th smal ler incr eases in inter est rates than otherwise. This in turn
keeps the labour mark et closer to f ull emplo yment.
That is wh y maintaining wel l-anchor ed inflation expectations is a k ey benefi t of inflation tar geting
frameworks, as I wi ll return to in a moment, and wh y it is important that inflation r eturns to be
sustainably in our tar get range.
The dual mandate in the post-pandemic period
So how did this dual mandate shape our pol icy response to the post -pandemic rise in inflation?10
 [
]
11
 [
]First, the starting point f or our monetary pol icy set tings mat tered – these wer e of course v ery
accommodativ e, with the cash r ate ef fectively at z ero.
Second, the causes of the pick -up in inflation wer e crucial. The ini tial pick -up in inflation w as partly
driven by some of the supply f actors I ha ve mentioned. T empor ary disruptions in global supply chains
during the pandemic led to str ong incr eases in goods prices, and the w ar in Ukr aine caused a spik e in
global ener gy prices.
But it was also clear that demand w as part of the story . Accommodativ e fiscal and monetary pol icy
settings in the pandemic period supported str ong gr owth in demand f or goods during lockdowns, and
this demand str ength inter acted wi th supply constr aints to ampl ify inflationary pr essures. Then, as
lockdowns eased and the econom y started to r ecover, demand f or services also r ecovered str ongly. As a
result, condi tions in pr oduct mark ets and labour mark ets wer e very tight b y mid-2022.
It was clear that we needed to incr ease inter est rates to bring about a bet ter balance between demand
and supply , which would help to ease domestic price pr essures. This need w as reinforced b y a concern
that longer run inflation expectations could incr ease. If this happened, i t would add to inflationary
pressure and would ul timately r equire a lar ger pol icy response, and higher job losses.
Although i t was clear that we needed to r aise inter est rates to slow demand gr owth, i t was less clear
how quickly demand pr essures needed to ease, how persistent global shocks or their ef fects would be,
and how much we could af ford to ‘look thr ough’ those ef fects.
The B oard could ha ve chosen to match the mor e signi ficant r ate incr eases of some other centr al banks
to bring inflation back to tar get mor e quickly . But this could ha ve risk ed a sharper and mor e persistent
increase in the unemplo yment r ate.
Instead, the B oard judged that a measur ed appr oach w as consistent wi th its dual mandate. W e
increased the cash r ate quickly at first – but we didn’ t go as high as some other centr al banks. W e then
held the cash r ate for over a y ear, even as some other centr al banks started easing monetary pol icy.
Throughout, we k ept a close ey e on longer term inflation expectations, to ensur e they r emained
anchor ed to the tar get.
This str ategy w as designed to r ein in inflation whi le also pr eserving as man y of the gains in the labour
market as possible – an example of our dual mandate in pr actice.12
 [
]
13
 [
]How has this pla yed out so f ar?
Since the peak of inflation in 2022, headl ine inflation has decl ined b y over 5 per centage points. And o ver
the same period ther e has been a r elatively modest easing in labour mark et condi tions. The
unemplo yment r ate has incr eased f rom ar ound 3.5 per cent in mid-2022 to 4 .2 per cent in the June
quarter this y ear, and r emains low b y historical standar ds.
Crucial ly, the shar e of the population in work has r emained ar ound r ecord highs; this is in contr ast to
declines in man y other adv anced economies (Gr aph 1).
The fact that unemplo yment has r emained low and emplo yment gr owth has r emained str ong is
remarkable – and v ery welcome.14

large decl ine in inflation. This is especial ly true compar ed wi th previous episodes of disinflation in
Australia (Gr aph 2).
Why is this?
Part of the answer is that the supply -driven price incr eases that I mentioned earl ier did turn out to be
tempor ary, even if they flowed thr ough to the econom y over a long period of time (Gr aph 3).  As
these supply disruptions ev entual ly subsided and oi l prices decl ined, price pr essures eased.15

 [
]And also as I mentioned earl ier, the B oard wer e very alert to the risk that inflation expectations could
increase. Crucial ly, that did not happen.
Instead, households and businesses continued to bel ieve that inflation would r eturn to the tar get range
(Graph 4). This l imited an y so-cal led ‘second-r ound’ ef fects on inflation, which al lowed inflation to f all
without a sharp rise in the unemplo yment r ate.Graph 3

 [
]This demonstr ates the point I made earl ier about how our two objectiv es can be complementary . A
history of low and stable inflation, and the r esulting publ ic confidence in the inflation tar get, enabled the
Board to adopt a str ategy that pr otected the labour mark et as much as possible whi le still ensuring
inflation came down.
How has the labour market adjusted in the current cycle?
I’ve already highl ighted the compar atively modest incr ease in the unemplo yment r ate over the past f ew
years f rom a v ery low lev el, and that o verall emplo yment has continued gr owing. The r ate of la yoffs has
increased only a l ittle and r emains at a r emarkably low lev el by historical standar ds (Gr aph 5). The shar e
of work ers who ar e long-term unemplo yed also r emains low .Graph 4

Economics; Employment Research Australia; Melbourne Institute;
RBA; Workplace Research Centre.These ar e good outcomes – as job losses ar e an especial ly painf ul way for the labour mark et to adjust to
tighter monetary pol icy. Losing a job can be one of the most str essful events in someone’ s life, and i t
can ha ve far-reaching impl ications f or families and communi ties.
While the unemplo yment r ate has risen since i ts trough in late 2022, including an uptick in the month of
June, ther e has been signi ficant jobs gr owth in aggr egate. I nstead, the labour mark et has adjusted in
some other – less disruptiv e – w ays.
First, job v acancies ha ve decl ined f rom a v ery high lev el as firms ha ve slowed hiring activi ty.
Second, the a verage number of hours that people ar e working has decl ined. This f ollows a period when
hours had incr eased sharply due to v ery str ong demand f or work ers (Gr aph 6).
Having y our hours cut is tough, but i t’s often pr eferable to losing a job al together . And i t’s worth noting
that some of this decl ine in hours has been v oluntary , especial ly over the past y ear or so .Graph 5

implying less upw ard pressure on w ages gr owth than otherwise (Gr aph 7).Graph 6

 [
]In summary , the gr adual easing in labour mark et condi tions has so f ar been most evident in f ewer job
vacancies, r eductions in hours work ed and decl ining r ates of v oluntary job swi tching.
These shi fts aren’t without their chal lenges, but they al l tend to be less disruptiv e than outright
job losses.
I should note that the RBA can’ t wave a magic w and and contr ol how adjustments in the labour mark et
play out. I nterest rates ar e too blunt an instrument f or that, and I am not her e to claim cr edit for the
fact that the adjustment has so f ar tak en place in a less costly w ay.
By the same tok en, because the labour mark et can adjust in di fferent w ays, we do not ‘tar get’ any one
adjustment mechanism, such as a set number of job losses, as we seek to bring demand and supply
back into balance. I ndeed, ther e have been substantial job gains o ver this period.

Sources:ABS; RBA.Let me bring the labour mark et story up to date.
Our o verall assessment at the time of our most r ecent f orecast in Ma y was that ther e was still some
tightness in the labour mark et, and we expected i t to ease a l ittle over the r emainder of this y ear.
A broad range of indicators underpinned this assessment, and in man y ways not much has changed.
Firms sti ll report signi ficant di fficulties finding labour , even if this constr aint has eased somewhat
recently . The r atio of v acancies to unemplo yed people r emains high (Gr aph 8).  At the same time,
unit labour costs ha ve been incr easing str ongly.
In May we also highl ighted the possibi lity that labour mark et condi tions could be less tight than we
thought. As I noted earl ier, the low r ate of job swi tching ma y imply less upw ard pressure on w age
growth than otherwise. And the quarterly r ate of underlying inflation has r ecently been ar ound a pace
that would be consistent wi th 2½ per cent in annual terms.21

Sources:ABS;NAB;RBA.For that r eason, our Ma y forecasts f or wages gr owth and inflation incorpor ated some down wards
judgement to r eflect the possibi lity that ther e is mor e capaci ty in the labour mark et – and the econom y
more broadly – than is suggested b y our usual assessment.
Last week br ought us the latest labour mark et data, which confirmed that the unemplo yment r ate
increased in the June quarter . Some of the co verage of the latest data suggested this w as a shock – but
the outcome f or the June quarter w as in l ine wi th the f orecast we r eleased in Ma y. That on i ts own
suggests that the labour mark et mo ved a l ittle further tow ards balance, as we wer e anticipating. Whi le
the June monthly data showed a noticeable pick -up in the unemplo yment r ate, other measur es – such
as the v acancy r ate – ha ve been stable r ecently . More broadly, leading indicators ar e not pointing to
further signi ficant incr eases in the unemplo yment r ate in the near term.
Nevertheless, the risks we highl ighted in Ma y remain. As alw ays, ther e is uncertaint y around how labour
market condi tions stand r elative to full emplo yment, and we wi ll continue to closely moni tor incoming
labour mark et data. Our A ugust Statement on Monetary P olicy will provide a f ull updated assessment of
labour mark et condi tions and the outlook.
Concluding remarks
So, to conclude, our goals of low and stable inflation and f ull emplo yment ar e closely l inked and
gener ally reinforce each other .
A critical f eature of the r ecent high-inflation period is that longer term inflation expectations r emained
anchor ed. This has enabled the B oard’s monetary pol icy str ategy of bringing inflation down in a
relatively gr adual w ay so as to l imit the easing in labour mark et condi tions.
Much of the r ebalancing of demand and supply in the labour mark et that has oc curred in r ecent y ears
has been r eflected in decl ines in job v acancies, hours work ed and v oluntary job swi tching. Ther e are
many ways the labour mark et can adjust. The RBA doesn’ t ‘target’ a speci fic outcome, l ike a certain
unemplo yment r ate or number of job losses, to r each f ull emplo yment.
Monetary pol icy cannot contr ol how the adjustment happens, but i f it can oc cur whi le keeping
emplo yment str ong – and ev en growing – that is a gr eat outcome f or work ers, families, communi ties
and the econom y.22

 [
]In the end, the best w ay to pr omote the economic wel fare of A ustralians is b y achieving low and stable
inflation alongside f ull emplo yment.
And that is what the B oard is constantly striving f or.
Thank y ou and I look f orward to taking y our questions.

To expand on this, i t is also the case that when the labour mark et is persistently deviating f rom full emplo yment,
inflation wi ll persistently deviate f rom its target.8
[

The emplo yment and inflation objectiv es are also complementary when ther e are influences that expand the pr oductiv e

Of course, ther e are limits her e. The longer a centr al bank permi ts inflation to r emain outside tar get, the mor e likely it is
