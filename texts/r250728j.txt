  Thank you, Avi .  It is an honor to be back with you at the NBER Summer Institute.  
Thanks to  you, Erik, and Catherine  for organizing these insightful and thought -provoking 
sessions this summer.1 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing across the globe and permeating  every corner of 
the economy at an incredibly rapid rate .  This  has significant  implication s for Federal Reserve 
leaders, both as  policymakers  and managers of the organization.  AI is transform ing the 
economy, including by accelerating  how quickly we generate ideas and making workers more 
efficient,  and that , in turn, will affect both  sides of our dual mandate of maximum employment 
and price stability.  AI also is beginning to affect  the way we  conduct economic research within 
the Federal Reserve System, with the potential to make some tasks more efficient , harness 
nontraditional data in new ways , and broaden and deepen economic analysis.  
I believe we are at an inflection point.  As I have stated before, I , like some of you here 
today, see AI as the next general -purpose technology (GPT)2.  As many of you in this room 
know and have written about, GPTs, like the printing press or electric power, matter immensely 
to innovation.3  Similar to  those seminal advances, AI  will likely  spread throughout the economy 
more broadly, spark innovation, and improve over  time.    
 
1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market 
Committee .

at the National Bureau of Economic Research Economics of Artificial Intelligence Conference,  Toronto, September 
22, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20230922a.htm . 
3 For the original notion of general -purpose technology, see , for example,  Timothy F. Bresnahan and Manuel 
Trajtenberg  (1995), “ General Purpose Technologies ‘Engines of Growth’ ?” Journal of Econometrics , vol. 65 
(January), pp. 83–108.  For an assessment of how IT can boost productivity in the early 21st century, see Boyan 
Jovanovic  and Peter L. Rousseau  (2005),  “General Purpose Technologies ,” in Philippe Aghion and Steven N. 
Durlau f, eds.,  Handbook of Economic Growth , vol. 1B (Amsterdam :  Elsevier ), pp. 1181 –224.  More recently , 
Eloundou and others (2024) note that generative artificial intelligence could be a GPT and provide a framework for 
assessing that ; see Tyna Eloundou, Sam Manning, Pamela Mishkin, and Daniel Rock  (2024) , “GPTs Are GPTs:  
Labor Market Impact Potential of LLMs,” Science,  vol. 384 (6702), pp. 1306– 08. Among large language models (LLMs) , the highest scores on benchmark intelligence 
tests have almost doubled over the past 12 months, according to the Artificial Analysis 
Intelligence Index.4  The competition to improve is fierce:  The leaderboard for the AI lab 
offering the best model switched six  times in the past half a year.  And the technology is 
diffusing rapidly .  ChatGPT launched about three years ago, and now more than half a billion 
users engage with the  internet- based LLM weekly.5  LLMs are super cool and grab the 
headlines, but there is a lot more to AI, which can be an important driver of productivity.  
Advances in multimedia  generation is another way to think of AI’s fast advancement .  It took 
human creators  decades to move from silent pictures to “talkie” movies ; AI models 
accomplished this advance in less than a year.    
AI is poised to alter the contours of the global economy.  In doing so, it has the potential 
to materially affect both sides of the Fed’s dual mandate.  On the maximum- employment side  of 
the mandate, AI c an generate new tasks and jobs and possibly eliminate others, similar to many 
past technological innovations.  On the price -stability side of our mandate, AI can improve 
productivity, which can lower inflationary pressures, but it can also boost prices in the interim , as 
AI adoption may lead to a surge in a ggregate investmen t.  Studying the net effects of AI on the 
economy over time will be critical to setting appropriate monetary policy.   However, at the Fed , 
we are not only  considering AI ’s implications for the economy but  also employing strategies to 
harness the technology’s power  inside our walls .

4566 -9da7- 4a7628c60bea/oai -ideas -to-power -democratic- ai-june-2025.pdf . Commensurate with rapid improvements in AI, its adoption is accelerating across 
government and industry.  As a result, there is an urgency for the Fed to both study AI ’s effects 
and capture more of its benefits to maintain a highly productive workforce and extract additional 
insights from new economic analysis.  
Having spent m uch of my career studying the innovation production function and 
collecting and examining data  on the economic effects  of technology, productivity, and 
innovation, I am coupling cautio n with this  optimism .  This is  consistent with my view when I 
was a research associate here at NBER and when I first spoke about AI at the NBER AI meeting 
in Toronto in 2018 before I joined the Board of Governors .  While I see AI  adoption as broadly 
beneficial to the economy and society, I know from economic history and the history of technology that there could  be many  multidimensional challenges to adopting it .  With that in 
mind , I will start by offering  general principles I believe guide our society’s engagement with 
AI.  Next , I will describe  recent progress on AI  research at the Fed .  I will then say a bit about 
both the opportunities and constraints  I see affecting the wider adoption of AI.  Finally, I will 
offer some brief remarks on how AI factors into my thinking on monetary policy . 
Responsible  AI Adoption 
I want to start by stress ing that any organization engaging with this technology should 
take a thoughtful and structured  approach to AI  adoption.  I can offer four guiding principles for 
what I view as responsible  AI adoption.  
First and foremost is establishing strong governance and risk management.  A central 
tenet of good governance should be the mindset that humans are in the loop, because it ensures that people guide AI rather than allow AI to guide us.  In a speech last year, I told a story about how Benjamin Franklin lost a game of chess to a machine called the “Mechanical Turk”6 Of 
course, there was a human chess master hidden inside.  What might seem like a silly tale 
contains an important lesson for organizations and government s deploying AI: Like the 
Mechanical Turk, ultimately the human inside the machine is still in charge.  Relatedly, organizations  also must be careful about privacy, cybersecurity, and leakage of confidential and 
internal information.  
A second principle is that education and training of staff are critical to get and keep 
employees at the technological frontier. A  third principle is empowerment.  Teams within 
organizations should be  encouraged to learn by doing and engage hands -on with AI technologies 
in controlled environments. Finally, a  fourth principle is experimentation .  Organization s should 
maintain a spirit of openness while retaining the ability to halt projects that do not  meet rigorous 
standards.  
AI Research at the Fed  
Like many other leading organizations and researchers around the world, t he Federal 
Reserve is working hard to understand AI’s implications for our mission and our own work.  To be clear, the FOMC is not using AI in developing or setting policy, but rather to aid staff in their other tasks  such as writing, coding, and research.  For example, w e have been deepening our 
understanding of the capabilities of LLMs and other machine learning models  to produce 
economic insights .

https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2024.020 . research  has provided important insights about  its limits and  where we should be careful about 
AI.  
By actively engaging with and learning about AI tools in our research, we not only 
enhance our analytical capabilities, but also gain invaluable insights into the broader economic 
implications of AI.  R esearch ers at the Fed  are also examining the state of AI adoption and the 
potential of AI to affect our economy. A  timely indicator of g enerative AI (GenAI) adoption in 
the U.S. has been developed  by St. Louis Fed economist Alexand er Bick , along with his 
coauthors Adam Bland in and David Deming , through a repeated survey.13  They  also find that, 
so far, GenAI adoption for uses outside of work has been faster than personal computer (PC) adoption after its introduction.  In the workplace, they find GenAI adoption has happened at a similar pace as occurred with PCs.  W ork from David Byrne and Paul Soto, along with coauthors 
Martin Baily  and Aidan Kane , suggests that GenAI has the potential to be a GPT and could 
benefit the economy in other ways too such as by being an invention that itself leads to more 
innovation.
14 
In addition, Fed staff from across our  divisions  keep abreast with the rapid developments 
in GenAI by engaging regularly  with other researchers and experts from academia, other central 
banks , and the industry through various seminars, workshops, interviews, and invited 
presentation series.   
Simultaneously, the research at  the Fed is proceeding deliberately and cautiously, as 
many AI tools are not yet ready  to be  put into production.  For example,  Leland Crane, Akhil 
 
13 See Alexander Bick, Adam Blandin, and David J. Deming (2024), “The Rapid Adoption of Generative AI,” 
NBER Working Paper Series 132966 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, September; 
revised February 2025), https://www.nber.org/papers/w32966 . 
14 See Martin Baily, David Byrne, Aidan Kane , and Paul Soto (2025), “Generative AI at the Crossroads:  Light 
Bulb, Dynamo, or Microscope ?” working paper, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.14588 .  Karra and Paul Soto show that  when it comes to real-time analysis, LLMs  suffer from look -
ahead bias and frequently get confused by the vintage nature of economic data releases .15  Even 
for historical analysis, the researchers note:   “From the perspective of historical analysis, an 
LLM may not reliably recall the details of real time data flow during historical episodes, limiting 
the reliability of historical analysis.”  
The Speed of Adoption  
Our experience with  AI at the Fed is also informative about why we are not seeing more 
widespread adoption of AI in the economy, despite its remarkable pace of improvement and the 
apparently large potential economic gains.   
First, as in all industries grappling with AI, the workforce must be trained to take 
advantage of a rapidly changing technology that is strikingly different from previous technologies .  Often, the premise of technology has been to automate routine tasks where the 
steps involved are predetermined.  The premise of AI is different from technologies of the past.  AI promises to augment areas of work involving human judgement, which do not follow any predetermined steps.  Thus, education and training must evolve .   
Second, l arge organizations learn  to use new tools through hands -on experimentation and 
shared experiences, and it takes time for the knowledge to diffuse .  Some of these are planned 
and organized, while others are more organic  and spontaneous .  For example, e arlier this year, 
the Board hosted an AI expo where AI early adopters shared their experiences with AI and 
innovative AI use cases.  Events such as this  showcase cross -functional, cross -organizational 
 
15 See Leland D. Crane, Akhil Karra, and Paul E. Soto (2025) , “Total Recall?  Evaluating the Macroeconomic 
Knowledge of Large Language Models,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2025- 044 (Washington:  Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2025.044 . collaboration among participants throughout the Federal Reserve System and demonstrate how 
AI-driven solutions could address challenges in areas such as economic analysis, financial 
stability, and operations.  These venues provide excellent  avenues for sharing successes and 
failures in trying out different use cases and, in many cases, enable the broader community to engage with prototypes of AI applications.  In addition to demystifying AI and encouraging its 
use, t hese events try to establish and promote  cultural norms of responsible AI usage, which 
generates ideas related to the types of problems AI is better or worse at solving .   
Finally, o rganizations will also have a rational desire to be selective about which 
advances to adopt when the technology is rapidly changing.  For example, we are seeing that some highly effective prompting strategies for older models are no longer necessary for thinking models.  As with any new general -purpose technology, t here is likely to be an extended period of 
learning by doing.  This will be particularly important for the high- profile LLM models.  With 
these models, even the developers are not fully  aware of their capabilities, and organizations, 
including the Fed, learn about their abilities and limitations only once they are put to use.   
Implications for Monetary Policy  
Given what we know , as well as what we learn from researchers like you, we are thinking 
carefully about the implications of AI for monetary policy.  As AI filters through the economy, it 
has the potential to affect both sides of our dual mandate  in different ways . 
As with other technological innovations, AI is poised to reshape our labor market, which 
in turn could affect our notion of maximum employment or our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment .  I see it as likely that AI will allo w workers to be more productive while also  
changing the tasks associated with  any given job.  As with many technological breakthroughs, a 
certain set of jobs may be replaced.  We must recognize the challenges and potential pain this may bring, and we are watching this closely.  A successful response to these disruptions will be 
of paramount importance  but l ies outside the mandate of  monetary policy .  Fortunately, new 
types of employment , whether tasks or occupations, are also being created.  
In terms of price stability,  AI is likely to boost  productivity and could help the economy 
achieve higher growth while reducing inflationary pressures , because those productivity 
improvements can  counter labor cost increases.  In addition, the ability of  AI to  process and 
analyze ever larger  amounts of data will likely lead to advances in scientific research and 
innovation, resulting in an increased arrival rate of  ideas, further amplifying its effect on 
productivity.  As I have noted in recent speeches , it is possible that the disinflationary effect of 
AI could, over time , counter any factors putting upward pressure on inflation.16  It is also 
possible  that AI could boost prices in the interim, as adoption of the technology might require a  
surge in aggregate investmen t. 
I am c onstantly  monitoring incoming data , the ever -evolving outlook, and a broad range 
of risks to both side s of the dual mandate.  I tend to be cautiously optimistic when I anticipate  
what AI could bring to the economy, but much uncertainty remains .  As I have laid out for my 
institution  specifically and the economy broadly, AI is a technology that is rapidly evolving, and 
it is good to be humble about our understanding of its exact effects on our economy and the timing of those effects.  
 
16 See Lisa D. Cook (2025), “Opening Remarks on Productivity Dynamics,” speech delivered at “Finishing the Job 
and New Challenges,” a monetary policy conference hosted by the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, 
Stanford, Calif., May 9, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250509a.htm . Conclusion 
To conclude, I see us at a moment of inflection  where AI is being deployed as a  general -
purpose technology.  Babies born today will ask what life was like before LLMs , just as today’s 
college students quiz us about what life was like before the internet and mobile phones .  This is a 
moment for excitement and optimism, but also one we are taking seriously at the Federal 
Reserve.  As I have described, AI will both change the economy for which we set policy and 
change how we can best operate as a central bank.  
Much more remains to be learned and understood about how AI will affect our economy 
and our everyday lives.  This  is why gatherings and discussions like these in the 48th  session of 
the NBER Summer Institute  are so important.  I am excited to learn about the careful and 
insightful  research presented  by former colleagues, graduate students, and many others  at the 
Summer Institute,  and I look forward to listening to the remaining discussions today.   
Thank you.
