    "## Why is the Scraped HTML Different from What You See in the BIS webpage?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Many modern webpages use JavaScript to load or update content after the initial HTML is sent by the server.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When scraping with `requests` or `wget`:**  \n",
    "  You only get the initial HTML, which is often just a simple shell, missing dynamically loaded data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What happens in the browser:**  \n",
    "  Your browser runs JavaScript code _after_ the page loads. This code fetches and inserts extra content (such as lists, tables, or paginated data) dynamically, which is why you see more information in your browser than in the raw HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Result:**  \n",
    "  The HTML you scrape differs from what you see because the browser adds content using JavaScript—content that isn’t present in the server’s initial response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **To scrape this dynamic content, you need to either:** \n",
    "> - Use browser automation tools (like `Selenium` or `Playwright`) to run JavaScript and see the “real” content.\n",
    "> - Analyze network requests to find and fetch the underlying data directly (e.g., from API endpoints)."
